# Expoxy

Epoxy is an c99 multimedia framework which aims to unify multiple rendering and operating system layers into agnostic code which will work of operating system, or rendering APIs. 

Epoxy was previously called TORN back in 2022. 

### A note on the next version of epoxy:

This has been outdated for a while, and there's signficant performance drains in the code, specifically regarding the rendering portions. There will be a refactor soon which aims to address those problems and provide more features such as a custom software renderer. Additionally, there will be a version bump for libraries like 'miniaudio' which has undergone signifcant changes from the last time epoxy was modified. An ETA has not been decided on so far, however the scope seems like 1-2 years from today's date.

The next iteration of epoxy will not support deprecated 1.xx functions.
